  ## Description

  The instructions for this project were to create a high-quality README template that would populate information provided by a user using Node CLI. Upon completion of the CLI questionnaire, the program succesfully produces a README markdown file in the current working directory.

  ## Installation

  To implement this program, you'll need to require node and fs modules and also install the inquirer package on npm. The index.js file with the command line prompt questions will need to be accessible in the current working directory, and the generateMarkdown.js file with the markdown syntax will need to be accessible in the utils folder.

  ## Usage 
 
  In VSCode, navigate to the index.js file, open the integrate terminal and enter node index.js. Complete the questionnaire and wait for your completed readme to populate in the folder.

  ## Contributing

  Contributions are welcome. My contact information is below.
 
  ## Challenges
 
  The biggest issue was getting the syntax down for writing the file, specifically figuring out from where to pull the data. I also had to remove the image prompt due to formatting issues. I hope to add it back in the future.

  ## Tests

  No tests were written for this program.
